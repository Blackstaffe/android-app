This is currently just a place holder. It will be filled with useful information once I get a chance until then have fun.


The app probably needs some fine tuning as I've recieved a couple errors through the play store.

TODO >

-Add the ability to use the aac stream in addition to the mp3 stream because its smaller and better quality.

Future plans (I don't want to really start adding this stuff until we have some sort of plan for what we are going to do with the iPhone app because I would prefer to have a fairly high level of consistency between the two) >

-Easy access to news programming
-Info about what your listening to (needs some sort of spreadsheet that will be consistently updated and also 
-Easy access to the cjsr twitter feed but a way to readf tweets about cjsr would be awesome.
